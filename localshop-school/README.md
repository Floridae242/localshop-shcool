## üìñ Project Overview

**AgriLink School Model** is a comprehensive digital platform that bridges the gap between school farm production and community consumption. Developed for **Baan Maehoyngoen School** (219 ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà 13 ‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ö‡∏•‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏ô ‡∏≠‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏†‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏î ‡∏à‡∏±‡∏á‡∏´‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà), this system addresses the critical challenge of small rural schools struggling with limited budgets while having surplus agricultural products.

### üí° Our Solution
A **transparent, easy-to-use web platform** that enables:
- **QR Code Traceability**: Instant verification of product origin
