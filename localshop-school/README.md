## 📖 Project Overview

**AgriLink School Model** is a comprehensive digital platform that bridges the gap between school farm production and community consumption. Developed for **Baan Maehoyngoen School** (Doi Saket, Chiang Mai), this system addresses the critical challenge of small rural schools struggling with limited budgets while having surplus agricultural products.

### 🎯 Core Problem Solved
- **Budget Crisis**: 80% of school's 100,000฿ annual budget goes to electricity
- **Surplus Waste**: Farm products left unused due to lack of systematic selling
- **Trust Gap**: Community wants safe food but doesn't know school's quality production  
- **Manual Systems**: Time-consuming paperwork reduces teaching time

### 💡 Our Solution
A **transparent, easy-to-use web platform** that enables:
- **QR Code Traceability**: Instant verification of product origin
- **Mobile-First Design**: One device manages everything
- **Community Integration**: Parents, teachers, and students collaborate
- **Revenue Generation**: Sustainable income for school operations
