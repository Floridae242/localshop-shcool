# Firebase App Hosting Setup Guide

## 🚀 Next-Generation Firebase App Hosting

Firebase App Hosting is the perfect solution for full-stack applications like our AgriLink School Model. Here's how to set it up:

### 🔥 What Firebase App Hosting Provides:

✅ **Full-Stack Deployment**: Both frontend and backend in one deployment
✅ **Server-Side Rendering**: Better SEO and performance
✅ **Automatic Scaling**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
✅ **Built-in CDN**: Global content delivery
✅ **Git Integration**: Automatic deployments from GitHub
✅ **Environment Variables**: Secure config management

### 📋 Prerequisites:

1. **Billing Enabled**: Firebase App Hosting requires a paid plan
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/localshop-shop/usage/details
   - Enable Pay-as-you-go (Blaze) plan
   - Don't worry - it includes generous free tiers

### 🛠️ Setup Steps (After Enabling Billing):

1. **Initialize App Hosting**:
   ```bash
   firebase init apphosting
   ```

2. **Configure for Node.js/Express**:
   - Select GitHub repository: `localshop-shcool`
   - Root directory: `localshop-school`
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist` or `build`

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only apphosting
   ```
